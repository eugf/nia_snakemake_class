Exercise:
  1. Write the following workflow with three steps. I have given a template.
  2. 
  It should be a matter of adding the correct container, envmodule, and conda yaml requirements.
  I've thrown in a couple wrenches that you will need to fix.
  IDEA: Make the conda one require python 2 instead of 3, so they will have to specify which version.
  Perhaps do a quick cutadapt module one. Just have it check whether the version output is correct.
